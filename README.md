# **Non pre-emptive CPU Scheduling Algorithm:**

## DESCRIPTION:
Non-Preemptive CPU Scheduling is a method where a process, once it starts running on the CPU, **cannot be stopped** until it finishes.  
- Also called **Non-Interruptible Scheduling**.  
- Decisions are made based on **arrival time (AT)** and **burst time (BT)**.

## TYPES:
1. **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**  
2. **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
3. **Longest Job First (LJF)**
4. **Priority Based Scheduling**
5. **Multi-level Queue**

## ADVANTAGES:
- Simple and easy to use  
- Fair for processes that come early  
- CPU is never interrupted  

## DISADVANTAGES:
- Long processes can delay short ones (**Convoy effect**)  
- Not good for real-time systems


### ***In non pre-emptive scheduling, Response time (RT) is always equal to Waiting time (WT)***
